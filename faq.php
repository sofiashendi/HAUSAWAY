		    <h1>FAQ</h1>
		    
		    <h2>What cities do you operate in?</h2>
		    
		    <p>For now, HAUS/AWAY offers its services in Montreal, QC. If you are close by and really need our help, contact us and let's talk!</p>
		    
		    <h2>What types of payment do you accept?</h2>
		    
		    <p>We use <a href="https://squareup.com" target="_blank">Square</a>, which means we accept most credit and debit cards on the market.</p>
		    
		    <h2>Do you deliver keys at any time of the day?</h2>
		    
		    <p>We offer key delivery 7 days a week from 9am to 5pm. If the key exchange must be done earlier or later, an additional fee of $25 will be charged.</p>
		     
		    <h2>Who will be meeting my guests?</h2>
		    
		    <p>We are a small team with years of experience in subletting and providing exceptional hospitality. The CEO is also the author of <a href="http://mtlstate.com" target="_blank">MTL State</a>, a lifestyle and food blog centered around Montreal. With their unique background in property management and extensive travel, they know what travellers want and what homeowners need.</p>
		    
		     <h2>What sets you apart from other property management and subletting services found in Montreal?</h2>
		     
		     <p>Most services only pay you back your monthly cost and require you to rent out your home for a minimum of 8 weeks. The seasonal nomads not only get left out but also miss out on making increased revenue. At HAUS/AWAY, we are all about transparency and helping you pay back more than just your mortgage. We will do our best to sublet your house or apartment, as often as possible and let you know you exactly how much money is being made. You will receive 80% of the rental revenue made when you return home. Hopefully, it will cover not only your monthly fees but also part of your trip!</p>
		    
		    <h2>I don't know what Airbnb is. Can you just sublet my house?</h2>
		    
		    <p>That's exactly what we are doing but instead of using websites like Craigslist or Kijiji, we use <a href="http://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> to pick trustworthy renters who have several reviews and verified profiles. Our priority is keeping your home safe after all!</p>
